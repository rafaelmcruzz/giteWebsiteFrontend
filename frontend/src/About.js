        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
        The property has 2 houses: main house (where we live), and a gite (where you will stay). Also has 3 outbuidings that you are very welcome to use, if you wish. Our two-bedroom gite, with double, king size bed and sofa bed has been tastefully furnished and decorated to a very high standard, catering for your every need, whilst retaining the authenticity of French gite life. The living room, combined with dining area has been added and decorated sympathetically, with original stone feature wall, Godin wood burning stove and comfortable. In the large, airy living room you will find a flat screen TV with DVD/CD player, many films in both English and French. Wifi is boosted for your modern-day technology and it's free! A very well stocked kitchen has every modern amenity, including dishwasher, microwave, full size fridge freezer, full sized electric oven and hob, a Nespresso coffee machine, loads of coffee, tea, sugar, oils, condiments ... and much more! A private garden at the rear of the property with its own patio is fully furnished with table and comfortable seating, large parasol, sun loungers, recliners, above ground pool and a charcoal BBQ for evening dining, al fresco.
        The property is surrounded by nature, green views and endless walks/hiking possibilities. We are perfectly placed for some of the best France has to offer. 7km from Aubeterre sur Dronne - one of the official Beaux Villages has many activities, such as bathing at the safe river beach, playground, tennis, canoeing, walking and sightseeing. A 12 minute drive will take you to Grand Etang de La Jamaye - our personal lake bathing beach - white sand, restaurant, cafe bars, safe bathing with life guards, free canoeing, body boarding and the most beautiful forest walks. Saint Aulaye, same distance, has some fantastic river bathing, beach bar and pizzeria, climbing ropes and open air swimming pool. We are about an hour away from the Dordogne Valley where you will find historic Eymet, Sarlat, Beynac, Roque Gageac, Rocamadour and much, much more. St Emilion vineyards can be found 50 minutes south of our Gite and stunning Bordeaux city just over an hour away. Perigieux is 45 minutes away and Bergerac just an hour - both steeped in history and fascinating to see, and our personal favourites. Vineyards at St Emillion and Bergerac are a short drive away.
